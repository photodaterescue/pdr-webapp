🟣 PRD — Google/Apple Photos Metadata Fixer (Full Product Requirements Document)
1. Executive Summary

Product Vision:
A simple, secure, browser-based tool that automatically fixes broken metadata and incorrect timestamps in Google Photos Takeout exports and Apple Photos exports, restoring the original creation dates and producing a clean, chronologically organised photo library. No installation required. No technical knowledge needed. Zero storage of user photos.

Market Gap:
Competitors offer general EXIF tools, large photo-management suites, or technical command-line utilities.
None provide a one-click, automated solution that understands Google Takeout JSON or Apple Photos export metadata.
Users struggle with messy exports and wrong dates — a problem unaddressed by current tools.

Target Users:

Everyday users exporting photos from Google/Apple

Parents/families backing up years of memories

Photographers migrating libraries

People switching cloud providers

Anyone frustrated by broken export metadata

The product fills a clear, underserved niche.

2. Goals & Success Metrics
Primary Goals (3–5):

Provide the simplest, fastest way to correct Google/Apple export metadata.

Minimise friction with a 100% browser-based tool requiring no installation.

Build trust with strict no-storage processing and instant deletion.

Deliver professionally organised ZIP files that users can immediately archive, back up, or import elsewhere.

Establish paid, sustainable monetisation via one-off purchase or upgrade tiers.

Success Metrics:

80%+ of users complete a full repair without support.

Positive user feedback (e.g., “finally fixes Takeout dates”).

Strong conversion rate from free demo → paid plan.

Low support burden due to predictable, automated workflow.

3. User Personas & Use Cases
Persona 1: The Family Archivist

Backing up years of children’s photos from Google Photos; sees wrong dates after export.
Needs a fast, trustworthy fix.

Persona 2: The Device Switcher

Migrating from Apple Photos to PC/Android and needs consistent dates across folders.

Persona 3: The Photographer

Has thousands of files with missing EXIF timestamps; wants batch correction done right.

Persona 4: The Non-Technical User

Wants zero complexity — upload ZIP → download fixed ZIP.

Underserved Segments:

Google Takeout users with JSON sidecars

Apple Photos users exporting large libraries

Users afraid of command-line tools

4. Feature Requirements
Five Shared Must-Have Features (baseline):

Batch metadata fixing — automated processing of thousands of files.

Correction of wrong creation dates — using Google/Apple metadata.

Simple upload → process → download flow.

Preview of processing summary (e.g., “3,912 photos repaired”).

Clean chronological organisation — sorted folders by year.

Three USP Differentiators (core innovation):

Native Google Takeout JSON parsing

Accept .json + .jpg pairs

Extract correct timestamps

Apply to EXIF automatically
Acceptance criteria: Handles all common Google Photos export formats.

Native Apple Photos export handling

Read Apple’s metadata (from “Export Unmodified Originals”)

Fix missing or wrong EXIF data
Acceptance criteria: Works with standard Apple export bundles.

Pure browser-based workflow with auto-deletion

Nothing stored

Temporary processing

Clear trust messaging
Acceptance criteria: All files removed from server immediately after ZIP delivery.

5. UX & Design Notes
Principles:

Clean, minimal interface.

One primary call-to-action: Upload ZIP.

Progress bar + status messages (“Fixing dates… Organising… Packaging…”).

Summary screen highlighting fixes.

Prominent privacy reassurance.

Optional settings collapsed (“Rename style”, “Sort by month”, etc.).

Flow:

Upload → Processing → Summary → Download.

6. Technical & Integration Requirements
Frontend:

Simple upload UI (HTML/Tailwind).

Progress indicators.

Download link for ZIP.

Backend:

Python + Flask/FastAPI

Libraries: Pillow, piexif, json, zipfile, tempfile

Temporary directory handling

Error handling for corrupted or mismatched JSON

Database:

None required.

Stateless, 100% temporary.

APIs:

None required.

Environment:

Replit for MVP

Auto-deletion with shutil.rmtree()

File-size limit (e.g., 2GB)

7. Pricing & Monetisation

Aligned with competitor price ranges but differentiated by simplicity:

Web Version

£25–£50 one-off

Optional: £10/month unlimited batch processing

Desktop Version (local-only privacy)

£40–£80 one-off

Premium trust value

Bundles

£60–£100 Google+Apple

Affiliate program for influencers

8. Competitive Positioning

Competitors = general EXIF editors, heavy photo suites, or command-line tools.

None offer native Takeout/Apple metadata repair.

None provide browser-based one-click fixing.

Position as the simplest, safest, most accurate way to fix Google/Apple exports.

9. Risks & Assumptions
Risks:

Large file uploads may stress servers → solution = file-size limits + desktop app.

Users may be privacy-sensitive → solution = strong messaging + local version.

Assumptions:

Users accept ZIP upload if deletion is instant.

Users prefer one-off pricing for utilities.

Google/Apple export formats remain stable.
